## GoGet Data Warehouse Project

This project is to create a relational database for GoGet, a car sharing platform, to store and maintain their database using OracleSQL. An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to represent entities and their relationships to each other in the database.

From the database, a data warehouse was developed in the star schema model to identify multiple revenue streams of GoGet and investigate potential growth opportunities that the company should target to increase profit.

The project was conducted under INFS2608 Database Management & Big Data Infrastructure course provided by UNSW.
